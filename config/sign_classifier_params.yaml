# sign_classifier_params.yaml
# ----------------------------
# Default ROS parameters for the traffic sign classifier node
# (sign_classifier_node.py).
#
# Weights path is set in pipeline.launch via <param name="weights">.
# All values here can be overridden at launch time or via rosparam set.

# Minimum EfficientNet B0 softmax confidence to publish a ClassifiedSign.
# The model produces a 15-class probability distribution; only the maximum
# class probability is compared against this threshold.
confidence_threshold: 0.5

# Topic from which to receive bounding boxes (DetectionArray published by
# the detector node).
detection_topic: /yolov10/detections

# Topic from which to receive the decoded source image for ROI cropping.
# Must match output_image_topic in detector_params.yaml.
image_topic: /yolov10/image_raw

# Topic on which to publish ClassifiedSignArray results.
# The SpeedLimitOCRNode subscribes to this topic to find speed_limit signs.
output_topic: /perception/traffic_signs

# Detector class name to filter for.  Only Detection messages whose
# class_name matches this string are passed to the classifier.
# Must match the BDD100K class name exactly (case-sensitive).
target_class: "traffic sign"

# Pixels added symmetrically around each bounding box before cropping.
# Signs with decorative borders (stop, yield) benefit from slight padding
# to capture the full sign shape.

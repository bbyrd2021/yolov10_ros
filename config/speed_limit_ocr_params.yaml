# speed_limit_ocr_params.yaml
# ----------------------------
# Default ROS parameters for the speed limit OCR node
# (speed_limit_ocr_node.py).
#
# This node subscribes to the sign classifier output and reads the numeric
# speed value off each speed_limit crop using EasyOCR.

# Topic from which to receive sign classifications (ClassifiedSignArray).
# Must match the output_topic in sign_classifier_params.yaml.
sign_topic: /perception/traffic_signs

# Topic from which to receive the decoded source image for ROI cropping.
# Must match output_image_topic in detector_params.yaml.
image_topic: /yolov10/image_raw

# Topic on which to publish SpeedLimitArray results for the autonomy stack.
output_topic: /perception/speed_limit

# Extra pixels added around the sign bounding box before cropping.
# Wider than the classifier default (5) because EasyOCR benefits from
# seeing the red border of the sign as a spatial context anchor.
roi_padding: 10

# Minimum crop height in pixels.  Crops shorter than this value are upscaled
# with bicubic interpolation before OCR.  EasyOCR text recognition accuracy
# degrades significantly below ~50 px character height; 64 px provides a
# comfortable margin.
min_crop_height: 64

# Minimum EasyOCR word confidence to accept a reading.
# EasyOCR returns per-word confidence in [0, 1].  Values below this threshold
# are discarded before the speed whitelist validation step.
ocr_confidence_threshold: 0.5

# CUDA device index ("0", "1", ...) or "cpu".
# Controls the gpu= flag passed to easyocr.Reader().
# A digit string → GPU; anything else → CPU.
device: "0"

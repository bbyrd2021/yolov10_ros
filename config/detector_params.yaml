# detector_params.yaml
# ---------------------
# Default ROS parameters for the YOLOv10 detector node (detector_node.py).
#
# These values are loaded via <rosparam> in pipeline.launch and can be
# overridden at launch time:
#   roslaunch yolov10_ros pipeline.launch detector_conf:=0.4
#
# Weights path is intentionally NOT set here; it is passed via the
# <param name="weights"> tag in the launch file so it can be resolved with
# $(find yolov10_ros)/models/ relative to the package.

# Minimum detector confidence to include a bounding box in the output.
# Lower values increase recall (more detections) at the cost of more
# false positives that downstream classifiers must filter.
confidence_threshold: 0.5

# Input image resolution fed to the YOLOv10 model (square, pixels).
# Must be a multiple of 32.  640 is the standard training resolution for
# BDD100K; reducing to 416 speeds up inference at a small accuracy cost.
inference_size: 640

# FP16 inference mode (Tensor Cores on Ampere GPUs).  Set to true for
# ~2× throughput improvement on RTX 30xx / 40xx.  Has no effect on CPU.
half: false

# Open a cv2.imshow() window with annotated detections (useful on the car's
# display during field tests).  Leave false in headless / Docker deployments.
view_image: false

# Publish an annotated image to annotated_image_topic for rviz / rqt_image_view.
# Slightly increases CPU usage due to the extra draw pass.
publish_annotated: false

# Topic names — usually left at defaults; override only if integrating into
# a larger ROS graph with conflicting topic names.
output_topic:          /yolov10/detections   # DetectionArray for classifiers
output_image_topic:    /yolov10/image_raw    # Decoded frame for ROI cropping
annotated_image_topic: /yolov10/annotated    # Debug annotated image (optional)
